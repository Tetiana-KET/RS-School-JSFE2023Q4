## Async Race ðŸš—

Educational project presented as a demo version for a Single page application (SPA) for managing a collection of cars, starting races and recording the result.

## Key Features:

- Two main views: "Garage" and "Winners", each with their name, page number, and a count of items in the database.
- Persistent view state between switches, maintaining user input and pagination.
 #### **Garage View**
- CRUD operations for cars with "name" and "color" attributes.
- Color selection from an RGB palette with a preview of the car in the chosen color.
- Pagination to display cars (7 per page) and a feature to generate 100 random cars at once.
 #### **Car Animation**
- Start/stop engine buttons with corresponding animations and handling of engine states.
- Adaptive animations that work on screens as small as 500px.
 #### **Race Animation**
- A button to start a race for all cars on the current page.
- A reset button to return all cars to their starting positions.
- Display the winner's name upon race completion.
####  **Winners View**
- Display winning cars with their image, name, number of wins, and best time.
- Pagination and sorting capabilities by wins and best times.

## Setup instructions

1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your machine before proceeding with the setup or installation process.
```
node -v
```
2. Make sure nmp is installed by running
```
npm -v
```
3. Fork this repo.
4. Clone your fork.
5. Run `npm ci` in the root directory. This command will install dependencies based on the exact versions specified in the package-lock.json. It ensures a consistent and reproducible environment by installing dependencies exactly as specified, making it ideal for use in development, testing, and deployment workflows.
You can use `npm ci` or `npm i` depending on your specific needs and requirements for dependency management.
If you want to install dependencies exactly as specified in the package-lock.json file (ensuring consistency and reproducibility), you should use `npm ci`.
If you're okay with potentially updating dependencies to their latest versions according to the specified version ranges in the package.json file, you can use `npm install` or `npm i`.
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development serve. If it works, then you are ready to make changes.

## Scripts available

### Build

To build the project run
```
npm run build
```
It will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### ESLint check

To check for code style and potential errors in the `src/` directory, including TypeScript and TSX files (--ext ts,tsx), run

```
npm run lint
```

It also reports any unused disable directives (--report-unused-disable-directives) and sets the maximum number of warnings to 0 (--max-warnings 0), which means ESLint will treat warnings as errors. This script helps quickly identify code style issues and potential errors in the project

### ESLint fix issues

To automatically fixe ESLint errors and code style issues in the `src/` directory run:

```
npm run lint:fix
```

### Check the production build

To check if the production build looks OK in your local environment use:

```
npm run preview
```

It will run scripts `vite build && vite preview` to create `dist` folder (if absent), build the project and boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173.

_It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server._

### ESLint and Prettier fix issues

To make ESLint fix code style issues, and then format code using Prettier in the `src/` directory - use

```
npm run format:all
```

It will run scripts `npm run lint:fix && npm run prettier:fix`

### Set up Git hooks

To automatically set up Git hooks for code linting and formatting, run the following command after installing project dependencies:

```
npm run prepare
```
