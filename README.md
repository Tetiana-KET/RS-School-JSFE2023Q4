- Hey there, My name is Tatiana, I am a passionate newcomer to the world of frontend development! Believe it or not, my journey into coding wasnâ€™t a childhood dream or a calculated career move. In fact, I never imagined myself delving into the tech world. My background? Well, letâ€™s just say itâ€™s far from the typical tech-savvy stereotype. I mean, I remember a time when I used to look at a computer and think, â€˜Okay, this is the mouse, and it clicks. Thatâ€™s about it.â€™ So, diving into the world of coding was like stepping into a whole new universe for me.

- I graduated with a degree in foreign languages from Fedkovech Chernovtsy University. However, that was long time ago, and my English skills have gathered a bit of dust. So, while I do have a foundation in English, itâ€™s fair to say that Iâ€™m a bit rusty. But hey, thatâ€™s where the beauty of learning comes in - Iâ€™m on a way to brush up on my skills and grow along the way.

- So, how did it start? â€“ It all started quite unexpectedly, really. My husband stumbled upon an ad for a week-long course â€˜IT Test Driveâ€™. It was a bit of a spur-of-the-moment decision - I joined the course alongside my husband, more out of a curiosity and fun than anything else. Little did I know, that seemingly random choice would set me on an entirely new path to the world of technology. I found myself drawn to the magic of JavaScript. And so, my self-taught journey began. Armed with determination and a thirst for knowledge, I immersed myself in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. It was the dawn of 2022, a challenging time for many. And for me the studying became a lifeline, a beacon of hope amidst uncertainty.

- Fast forward to today, and Iâ€™ve made a significant progress. Iâ€™ve learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, explored version control with Git, get acquainted with algorithms and data structures. Iâ€™ve also started to familiarize myself with tools like Node.js and Webpack.

- Currently I am taking the RS School Front-end course, and I am proud to have excellent results. Throughout the course, Iâ€™ve completed a range of projects, from crafting a responsive coffee shop website with usual functionality, such as burger menu slider, category switching and so on, to developing an intricate game - Nonograms - a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture. Each project pushed me to new heights, challenging me to think creatively. Though, Wrestling with webpack and untangling the complexity of component-based architecture tested my patience and resolve, the thrill of mastering new concepts and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges fuel my passion for learning.

- Iâ€™m excited for whatâ€™s to come. I know thereâ€™s more to learn and challenges to face, but Iâ€™m ready to tackle them. So, Iâ€™am going to continue my mind blowning journey into the fairy world of IT, to achieve success, embrace the unknown, seize opportunities, never backing down from a challenge, and make my mark on the ever-evolving landscape of frontend development.
