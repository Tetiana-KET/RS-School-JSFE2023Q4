						skeptical. Most people thought React was a huge step backward. 2014

					<h6>Virtual DOM</h6>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the Virtual DOM?</li>
						<li>How Does It Work?</li>
						<li>Benefits of the Virtual DOM?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						ReactJS core concepts include components, VDOM , JSX, state, and
						props. The Virtual DOM is an abstract representation of the actual
						DOM. It’s stored in memory and is not directly visible to users.
						React maintains a lightweight copy of the UI in the Virtual DOM. The
						VDOM serves as an intermediary between your React components and the
						real DOM. Understanding the Virtual DOM can help developers write
						more efficient and performant ReactJS applications. When you make
						changes to your React components (e.g., updating state or props),
						React creates a new Virtual DOM. React then compares this new VDOM
						with the previous one. It identifies the differences between the two
						representations. Finally, React updates only the necessary parts of
						the real DOM based on these diffs. Benefits of the Virtual DOM:
						Efficiency: By minimizing direct DOM manipulation, React improves
						performance. Batch Updates: React batches multiple changes together,
						reducing the number of DOM updates. Declarative API: You describe
						the desired UI state, and React handles the rest. Abstraction:
						Developers don’t need to manually manipulate attributes or events on
						the real DOM.

					<aside class="notes">
						In React, a component is a reusable building block, a piece of the
						UI that has its own logic and appearance. Components allow you to
						break down your application into smaller, manageable parts. A
						component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire
						page. The key points about components are: Modularity: Components
						promote modularity by dividing your UI into smaller, self-contained
						units. Reusability: You can reuse components across different parts
						of your application. Composition: Components can be combined to
						create more complex UIs.

					/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Functional Components are simple JavaScript functions that return
						JSX (JavaScript XML) elements. Once you’ve declared one component,
						you can nest it into another component. Notice that React component
						names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must
						be lowercase.

					<h3>Core Concepts of React.js</h3>
					<h6>ReactJS State vs Props</h6>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
							Props are a way to pass the data or properties from one component
							to another
						</li>
						<li>
							State is a built-in object in React that allows components to
							manage their own data
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Props and state are both plain JavaScript objects. Props are a way
						to pass the data or properties from one component to other
						components. Whether you declare a component as a function or a
						class, it must never modify its own props. All React components must
						act like pure functions with respect to their props. State is a
						built-in object in React that allows components to manage their own
						data It exists and can be used inside the component, cannot be
						accessed or modified outside the component. Works very similarly to
						a variable that is declared inside a function that cannot be
						accessed outside the scope of the function in javascript. State Can
						be modified using this.setState. The main significant difference
						between states and props is that props are used to transfer data
						from a parent component to a child whereas states are used to manage
						the data inside a component itself.

					<h6>Displaying data</h6>
					<img src="./images/display1.png" alt="code" />
					<img src="./images/display2.png" alt="code" />
					<aside class="notes">
						JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you embed
						some variable from your code and display it to the user. You can
						also pass variable to attributes, but you have to use curly braces.
						In the example, className="avatar" passes the "avatar" string as the
						CSS class, but src={user.imageUrl} reads the JavaScript
						user.imageUrl variable value, and then passes that value as the src
						attribute.

					<h6>Displaying data</h6>
					<img src="./images/stringConcat.PNG" alt="code" />
					<aside class="notes">
						You can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces
						too, for example, string concatenation. In this example, style={{}}
						is not a special syntax, but a regular {} object inside the style={
						} JSX curly braces. You can use the style attribute when your styles
						depend on JavaScript variables.

					<aside class="notes">
						React is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user
						interfaces. It allows you to assemble a complex UI from small,
						isolated pieces of code called “components.” Components are the
						building blocks of ReactJS applications and can be reused across
						different parts of the application. ReactJS has become a popular
						choice for building web applications due to its ease of use and
						flexibility. Its virtual DOM allows for efficient rendering and
						updating of components. Additionally, ReactJS provides a robust
						ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it easy to integrate with
						other frameworks and technologies. ReactJS also allows for code
						reusability, which can save developers time and effort when building
						complex applications. JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that
						allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. Any
						valid JavaScript expression inside curly braces are available.
