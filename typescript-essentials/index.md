# üåü Personal Reflections on Completed TypeScript Modules 

## 1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**

üí° **Central Concepts**

* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it extends JS with additional features
* The core feature of TypeScript is its type system. 
* Through static type checking, TypeScript catches code issues early in development 
* Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, it can automatically infer the data type
* All JS code is also TS code, and a TS program can consume JavaScript


üéì **Skills gained:**

* Learned TypeScript advantages over JavaScript in web development
* Learned to work in typescript playground
* TypeScript Installation
* Setting up TypeScript projects in Visual Studio Code


üíª **Practical Implementation**

* From this module I found out what is the TypeScript language, why it was created, it's code features and how to use it for 
* JavaScript development. 
* I set up a TypeScript development environment for future exercises. 
* Create my first .ts program, compiled it into .js and rendered into browser.


## 2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**

üí° **Central Concepts**

* TypeScript enables you to add static types to your JavaScript code
* Explicit type annotations are optional in TypeScript
* If a variable wasn't assign to a type or initialized when it was declared, it would be inferred of type "any"
* Explicit type declarations is preferable,  it provide a documentation of your code intention
* All types in TypeScript are subtypes of a single top type called the any type.
* The void type exists purely to indicate the absence of a value
* The null and undefined types are subtypes of all other types
* Enumeration type, or enum, allows to create sets of constants for use with variables and properties.
* While flexible, the "any" type can cause unexpected errors. One should avoid using "any" when it's not necessary.
* The core feature of "unknown" - it is impossible to interact with a variable of type unknown
* To treat a variable as a different data type, one can use a type assertion, It tells the compiler, the developer knows what he is doing.
* The union type restricts the assignment of values to one of several specified types
* An intersection type combines two or more types to create a new type that has all properties of the existing types
* There are three sets of literal types available in TypeScript: string, number, and boolean
* Narrowing - The process of going from an infinite number of potential cases to a smaller, finite number of potential cases
* Tuples - an array that contains values of mixed types. To declare a Tuple, use the syntax variableName: [type, type, ...].

üéì **Skills gained:**

* Get acquainted with types and subtypes in TypeScript.
* Get an understanding of the advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript.
* Variables declaration using primitive types, object types, union and intersection types.
* Get acquainted with core features of enum.
* Get acquainted with two forms of type assertion: (randomValue as string).toUpperCase(); (<string>randomValue).toUpperCase(); (as is preferred)
* Usage of Type guards, conditional test to learn the type of a variable
* Learned to use "unknown" type and "any" when needed, and got the difference
* Learned to work with union and intersection types


üíª **Practical Implementation**

* From this module I found out more details about TS types and it's usage
* Using enumerations: Helps reduce errors; Makes it easy to change values in the future; Makes code easier to read
* Using the any type allows to call: A property that doesn't exist for the type; randomValue as a function;   A method that only applies to a string type.
* Using union can be helpful when a value is received  from a library, an API, or user input
* Intersection types are most often used with interfaces to create a new intersection type with properties from both interfaces.
* Using literal types let to specify several values that a string, number or boolean can have (type testResult = "pass" | "fail" | "incomplete")

## 3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**

üí° **Central Concepts**

* An interface describes the properties and return types, while a function or class defines the implementation details.
* A type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties whereas an interface is always extendable.
* The TypeScript coding guidelines suggest interfaces should not start with the letter I
* Properties of an interface can be required, optional(firstName?), or read only (readonly firstName: string;).


üéì **Skills gained:**

* Understanding of the difference between an interface and a type alias 
* Declaring and implementing an interface
* Extending an interface with one or more interfaces
* Create indexable types
* Interface usage


üíª **Practical Implementation**

* Use interfaces to describe an object, naming and parameterizing the object's types, and to compose existing named object types into new ones. After defining an interface, you can use it as a type.
* You can use an interface to:
  1. Create shorthand names for commonly used types.
  2. Ensure that proper values are being passed into properties, constructors, or functions, especially when working with a team.
  3. Describe existing JavaScript APIs and clarify function parameters and return types. The interface provides you with a clear understanding of what an API is expecting and what it will return.
