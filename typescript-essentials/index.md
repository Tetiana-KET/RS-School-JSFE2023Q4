# 🌟 Personal Reflections on Completed TypeScript Modules 

## 1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**

💡 **Central Concepts**

* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it extends JS with additional features
* The core feature of TypeScript is its type system. 
* Through static type checking, TypeScript catches code issues early in development 
* Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, it can automatically infer the data type
* All JS code is also TS code, and a TS program can consume JavaScript


🎓 **Skills gained:**

* Learned TypeScript advantages over JavaScript in web development
* Learned to work in typescript playground
* TypeScript Installation
* Setting up TypeScript projects in Visual Studio Code


💻 **Practical Implementation**

* From this module I found out what is the TypeScript language, why it was created, it's code features and how to use it for 
* JavaScript development. 
* I set up a TypeScript development environment for future exercises. 
* Create my first .ts program, compiled it into .js and rendered into browser.
